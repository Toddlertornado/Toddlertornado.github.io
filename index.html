                Happy end of the school year!<br>
                I had a great time in fifth grade, you were a great teacher!<br>
                Thank you for everything you taught me!<br>
                I hope I see you soon!<br>
                I will miss Morningside a lot, it was all too much fun!<br>
                I will really miss the joys of 5th grade!<br>
